## Description:

A cross-platform library for creation, storage, management of commands and command packages. 
Execution of commands, parsing of files with command packages.
 
Used to create utilities for working with commands (execution, launch, autorun, storage).

You can keep your commands in simple and understandable files, collect them in one place,
split into named categories (packages) and execute at any time:

The files must have the extension *.cfg, or *.json and have the correct structure:


### commands.cfg:

```text
[package name 1]
command 1
command 2
command N

[package name 2]
command 1
command 2
command N
```

### commands.json:

```json5
{
  "name1":

  [
    "command1",
    "command2",
    "commandN"
  ],

  "name2":

  [
    "command1",
    "command2",
    "commandN"
  ]
}
```
